Console.py is the command interpreter that we can use to manage the objects of this project.  
To start this command interpreter, run: $ ./console.py  

You can use it to:  
1.Create a new instance of a class, saves it (to the JSON file) and prints the id. Ex: $ create BaseModel  
2.Print the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id. Ex: $ show BaseModel 1234-1234-1234.  
3.Delete an instance based on the class name and id (save the change into the JSON file). Ex: $ destroy BaseModel 1234-1234-1234.  
4.Print all string representation of all instances based or not on the class name. Ex: $ all BaseModel or $ all.  
5.Update an instance based on the class name and id by adding or updating attribute (save the change into the JSON file). Ex: $ update BaseModel 1234-1234-1234 email "aibnb@mail.com".
